# Hi, I'm Cyrus. ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm currently a student at the University of Queensland, pursuing a dual degree in **Mathematics** and **Computer Science**. My areas of focus are **Pure Mathematics** and **Machine Learning**, where I am deeply interested in exploring the theoretical underpinnings of algorithms and their practical applications.
